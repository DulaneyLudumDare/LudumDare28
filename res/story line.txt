Three spies have been captured by the armies of an opposing nation.
Each of these prisoners is capable of using magic.
Knowing this, the warden of the prison has placed them in the labyrinth; a magical series of mazes that has a binding spell on it that suppresses life force when it detects its use.
The clever spies discover that, if they use magic that is very weak and the spell used is only held by the same person for a short period of time, the binding spell will not activate.
The other thing they notice is that the gates that the jailers use to put prisoners in the jail and to exit the jail afterwards are protected from the binding spell so that magic can be used to seal the doors.
The gates can be forced opened, but only with the combined power of all three of the spies.
